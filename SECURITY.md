# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel student exams, please send an e-mail to Bagher Keshmiri via bagherkeshmiri@gmail.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
